# The Knapsack Problem, A Greedy Approach

___

In this repository, I implement a greedy algorithm to solving the knapsack problem.
To view the Implementation, open the  `Knapsack.ipynb` file for a jupyter notebook version. You can also open the `Knapsack.py` file for a `.py` version.

Feel free to clone this repository and run the files on your local machine.
